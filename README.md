# Omeddle
Unofficial Omegle app for Windows Phone 8.1 - with a twist

Due to increased anti-bot measures on Omegle, users of the app started being detected as bots (due to the very un-browserlike behavior of making raw requests to Omegle servers).
As I don't have enough time to work on the app anymore, I just threw it up on GitHub. 
The Store description below provides a good overview of the app's features compared to the web-based chat.
The code is definitely not of the highest quality, especially when compared to my current work in C# / .NET.

Don't just chat with Omegle users, meddle with them!

Omeddle is a fully featured Omegle client:
- Classic Chat, Ask Question, and Answer Question modes
- Persisting topic list
- One-click image sharing through Imgur
- Easy chatlog sharing with Pastebin
- Question storage

Not only can you chat, you can also control!
Sit between two unsuspecting Omegle users and control the conversation:
- Simple find and replace
- Support for powerful regular expressions for matching
- Send a message to both users, or just one while masquerading as the other user

Also features image management: view and delete all images you uploaded during previous chats.
